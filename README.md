## Introduction

This project was created as a JavaScript exercise during the **Start2Impact** course.  
The goal is to build an application that allows users to increment or decrement a starting value of 0.  

Key aspects of the project:  
- The initial value "0" is always displayed on startup.  
- The "+" and "-" buttons are dynamically generated using DOM manipulation with JavaScript.  
- Frameworks are not allowed.  
- The project includes a mobile-first responsive design and error handling to ensure that the buttons and initial value are correctly created before being displayed.
